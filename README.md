# Face mask detection system
A full guide to make a face mask detection system using OpenCV.

# Importance of this project
I have created this system that detects the face and then recognizes if a person is wearing a face mask   or not, and, if th former is true, then detect if it is positioned correctly or incorrectly. As to why we selected to do this project? The reason is as you are already familiar that in 2020 our lives changed because of the global issue of Covid-19. The virus started spreading everywhere through the air and every country made wearing face masks mandatory. The reason for wearing a face mask was to stop the spreading of the Covid-19 virus and to protect everyone. Even now many people are vaccinated, and the spreading of the virus is also very less but still, there are places where wearing a face mask is mandatory. Mostly crowded places like public gatherings. So, creating an artificially intelligent system that can detect if a person is wearing a face mask or not is very useful. If a person is not wearing a mask then the system will tell the authorities by sending alerts.

# How to run the project
Follow these steps if you want to use this project or make the whole project from scratch. 
1. Clone the project on your local machine. 
2. Download Anaconda.
3. Using command line go to the main directory of the project and create a new environment with this command.
```
python -m venv facemask
```
4. After creating the environment then activate the environment with this command. 
```
.\facemask\Script\activate
```
5. Download all the required packages by going in to the "**1_Installation**" folder and type this command. It will download all the required packages for the project. 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
6. Open "**03_prediction**" file  in jupyter notebook. This file is located in "**2_Machine_Learning**" folder.
7. Run all the code cells and at the end you will be able to detect face mask in any image or in realtime.
